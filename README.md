## Notes

#### Solution code cells

You can always start working by removing this line of comment: 

```
# ADD YOUR CODE HERE
```

We are checking your solutions semi-automatically. Please use the suggested
variable names when writing your code. 

#### Non-editable code cells

Some of the code-cells are ‘non-editable’ which means that you are supposed to
run them, but you are not able to edit them. These non-editable code cells
should help you test your code while you proceed. 

#### *No* immediate feedback

This week’s exercise is more complex, and there often exists more than one way
to solve a problem. For this reason, exercise 4 is *not graded automatically*.
Use the cells marked `# NON-EDITABLE CODE CELL FOR TESTING YOUR SOLUTION` to
check whether your code works.
